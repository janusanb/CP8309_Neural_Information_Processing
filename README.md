Contains the files required to classify the celebrity by their voice, as well as a secondary classification model for their respective emotional state
README for CPS 8309 - Neural Information Processing Final Project

For the emotional classifier the code is _originally sourced from Eu Jin Lok's Kaggle based Notebook entitled_ - Audio Emotion Classifer
Parts 1-4 were used to contrive my implementation. The areas which I have augmented, I have included in my implementation.

For the celebrity classification model, the Neural Network and the librosa code to convert to cepstral coefficents was used from
Eu Jin Lok's codebase, specifically Part 2 and Part 3 of the notebook
Part 2: https://www.kaggle.com/ejlok1/audio-emotion-part-2-feature-extract
Part 3: https://www.kaggle.com/ejlok1/audio-emotion-part-3-baseline-model/data

The website linking to the notebook, part 1: https://www.kaggle.com/ejlok1/audio-emotion-part-1-explore-data
To run this code, the RAVDESS databse and the VoxCeleb1 database are required:
RAVDESS: https://www.kaggle.com/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio
VoxCeleb1: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox1.html
* Note: The files could not be included in the submission as it was too large.
